## Identifying Ride Service Hotspots in New York City

With the increase in urban population, city agencies have been struggling to manage their resources efficiently.
In most of the metropolitan cities, number of people who use public transportation has increased drastically and city agencies
don’t have enough resources to suffice every need. This project addresses one urban issue that has been a major challenge for
most of the cities in the world. Since more and more people from the metropolitan cities are relying shared and solo cab
services, we wanted to identify the areas that have the maximum number of trips either by Uber or the yellow and green cabs 
in NYC. By analyzing these hotspots, we can give recommendations for the optimization of trip routes, especially in the 
case of shared cab services. We also analyzed the ridership patterns and how weather can affect user preferences towards
their commute options.
